# servant-playground

This is not a real project.  It's just a place for me to learn about Haskell
Servant and related techs.  

So far this just does some very basic restful CRUD and embeds a websocket
server under /chat/:chatroom.

No guarantees that this works, or even that it's a good source of example code to follow.
