# servant-playground

This is not a real project.  It's just a place for me to learn about Haskell
Servant and related techs.  

So far this just does some very basic restful CRUD and embeds a websocket
server under /chat/:chatroom, with distinct chatrooms for each room name,
created on demand..  The chat server works with my similarly silly/exploratory
[PureScript chat client](https://github.com/nathanic/purescript-simple-chat-client).

![no idea what i'm doing](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/234/786/bf7.gif)

No guarantees that this works, or even that it's a good source of example code
to follow.  I'm just figuring stuff out.
